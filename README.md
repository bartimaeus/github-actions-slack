# github-actions-slack

I needed something that would notify Slack from GitHub Actions similar to how Bitbucket Pipelines notifications currently works.

Initially, I was using a bash script, but adding the Slack markdown in the pretext caused issues with the Slack API. So, I'm using node until I can troubleshoot the bash script more.

# Usage

_coming soon_
